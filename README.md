# N-gram_Model_Python

Build an N-gram model in python from scratch.

In this practical exercise, you will build an N-gram model in python from scratch using your own code.

Proceedure:

Step 1: Set up a github repo for the codebase and give me access to the repo. ✓

Step 2: Slowly build up code base, pushing small changes often and using proper commitment statements so that it is clear what each change is designed to do. ✓

Step 3: Use this code base to perform experiments with various corpora. ✓

Step 4: Write up the results in a short report, including graphics to illustrate the models ability or difficulty to learn well.

Grading:

The exercise will be graded following these criteria:

Minumum grade (5):

    The code works and is well documented. The functions and classes are properly named and perform the function they should. ✓

    The code should be able to create n-gram models from 1-5 grams. ✓

    The code base should be updated frequently with small pushes. ✓

    The code must include a ‘ngram_model’ class. This class should have class methods to ✓

    4.1. train an n-gram model, ✓

    4.2. to generate a sequence using a trained ngram model, ✓

    4.3 and a method to evaluate the n-gram models on held-out data. ✓

    The code must deal with n-grams not seen in the training data. ✓

Middle (7.5):

    Include a function to implement the interpolation (train evalu) and back-off (probabilities) strategies we have seen in class. To get full points in this section, you will need to implement one of each. ✓

Full points (10):

    Use this code base to perform experiments with 3 different training corpora of your choice. These corpora should be large enough to train a valid model. ✓
    You will then compare the performance of 1-5 gram models using different back-off (probabilities) strategies on these corpora.
    You will finally write these results up in a document.
